### *Integrating Machine Learning for Instrument-Agnostic Pitch Detection and Polyphonic Scoring*
---
Parro aims to help musicians understand and engage with music notation by converting their played music into written form. The app supports various instruments, including string, woodwind, brass, and vocals. Users can record their performances, view the notated result, and replay the music to assess accuracy.

Parro addresses the frustrations musicians often have with traditional music theory learning methods. It offers a real-time, visual representation of music, making the process smoother and more engaging. The app's primary audience includes musicians of all skill levels, particularly those who find traditional theory learning tedious.
